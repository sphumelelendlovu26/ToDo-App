# 📝 React To-Do App

A simple yet functional To-Do List app built with **React**.  
This project was created as part of my journey to deeply understand the **fundamentals of React**.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project was to:

- Practice and reinforce my understanding of **React basics**
- Learn how to manage **state** using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Build reusable **components**
- Handle **user interactions** (clicks, edits, deletions)
- Improve my **JavaScript logic** and structuring
- Experiment with **conditional rendering**, **list rendering**, and **form handling**
- Get comfortable using **icons**, **custom styling**, and **Tailwind CSS**

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- 🗑️ Delete tasks with a smooth exit animation
- ✏️ Edit tasks inline with keyboard or blur save
- ⭐ Mark tasks as favorite
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- 🎨 Responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS**
- 📁 Clean and functional React component structure

## 🚀 What's Next

- Add localStorage support for task persistence
- Add filters for All / Favorites / Completed
- Drag and drop task reordering
- Better visual feedback and animations (maybe using **Framer Motion** or **GSAP** later)

## 📚 What I Learned

- Writing cleaner, component-based React code
- Passing props and lifting state
- Handling form inputs and controlled components
- Working with conditional classes
- Using external icon libraries like `react-icons`
- Thinking in React and debugging UI state

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project is part of my daily grind toward becoming a **senior front-end developer**. I'm learning by building and constantly pushing myself to improve.
